# Vulkan Development Environment Setup

This project uses Vulkan for graphics programming. Below are the steps I followed for setting up the development environment.

## Installation Instructions

For detailed installation instructions, I referred to the Vulkan tutorial:

- [Vulkan Development Environment Setup](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment#page_Linux)

### Notes for Arch Linux Users

I am using Arch Linux, so the installation steps I followed are tailored for this distribution. If you are using a different Linux distribution, please refer to the general Linux instructions provided in the Vulkan tutorial:

- [Vulkan Development on Linux](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment#page_Linux)

## Additional Resources

- For further details on setting up Vulkan, please consult the [official documentation](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html).
- If you encounter issues, the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vulkan) can also be helpful.
